## Project objectives
Our goal is to develope a door lock system with a 4x3 keyboard control, a relay, a display, an uart, leds controlled by atmega328p microcontroller.
The system we have designed has to open the relay that represent a door, when a right code is introduced and signal the operation.
There are four correct password, if case one of them is introduced, the door relay is opened and the green led is turn on. In case a wrong code is introduced, the relay is going to remain closed and the red led will be turned on.
